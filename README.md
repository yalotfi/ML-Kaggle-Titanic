# ML-Kaggle-Titanic
Build machine learning models to predict survival of the Titanic disaster.

# JavaScript and D3
I used D3.js as a tool for exploring the titanic dataset, guiding most of the feature engineering before implementing any learning algorithms.

# Python vs. R
Use both! This whole side project is a way to use multiple languages.  For example, I could cut out the D3 workflow and just use R Shiny or Bokeh, but I wouldn't learn data visualization in JavaScript.  Likewise, I could ignore R's statistical nature and only rely on the sci-kit learn and pandas libraries, but same rationale: this is not about efficiency but rather learning.

# Other Kaggle Projects
After fleshing out some predictive models on the Titanic dataset, I think I'll start doing some hand-written digit prediction trained on MNIST's dataset.  That would be a great case for nueral nets and the tensorflow library.  Would be a good introduction to image classification, the basis for a lot of cutting edge ML.
